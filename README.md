# chat-server
A server providing websocket connections build in GO.

This is a personal test. This webserver is created purely for fun & serving websocket connections to a front end. The front end is located in a different repo: [https://github.com/martivel/chat-client](https://github.com/martivel/chat-client).

The code will eventually be optimized & improved. For now it's sufficient enough (creating a HTTP server and providing Websocket connections).
