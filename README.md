# chat-server
A server providing websocket connections build in GO.

This is a personal test & exercising GO and creating a (websocket) client. The client will is located in a different repo: [https://github.com/martivel/chat-client](https://github.com/martivel/chat-client).

The code will be optimized & improved. For now it's sufficient enough (creating a HTTP server and creating Websocket connections).
